Use the GitHub search API to dispplay interesting stats: https://developer.github.com/v3/search
GitHub search API & possibilities: https://gist.github.com/jasonrudolph/6065289#file-01-trending-repos-md


The app should...
- Display most popular repos (top 10/n) in the last month / 6 month / 1 year
- Display most popular language overall on Github (may be apply filters - in last month | last 6 months | last year)
- Display most popular repos (top 5/10/n) by Language (apply filters - Ruby | JavaScript | Python | Objective-C)
- Most popular users (top n) by Langauge
- Any other interesting GutHub stats/data you can think?


- Should use native JavaScript (front-end only)
- Should work on major browsers (Chrome/Safari/IE)
- Filters could be dynamic - meaning UI could provide ability to pick filters dynamically and see the results change
- Use some chart library to display these stats


Nice to have
- Custom UI/CSS (non-bootstrap)
- Great design, UX
